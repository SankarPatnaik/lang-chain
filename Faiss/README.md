# Vector Database with FAISS

This repository provides an introduction to vector databases using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search). It includes a step-by-step guide on setting up a vector database and performing similarity search operations, with code examples to illustrate the process.

## Introduction

Vector databases are essential for managing and querying large sets of high-dimensional vectors. These are particularly useful in applications such as recommendation systems, image search engines, and natural language processing (NLP) tasks, where similarity search is critical.

In this project, we explore the concept of vector databases using FAISS, a popular library developed by Facebook AI for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- FAISS (`pip install faiss-cpu` or `pip install faiss-gpu` for GPU support)
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib (for visualization)
