# RAG-based Model Demo using Google PaLM

Welcome to the repository for demonstrating end-to-end implementations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Google's PaLM model. This repository will serve as a learning resource for anyone interested in understanding and applying RAG-based models in real-world scenarios.

## Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines retrieval mechanisms with generative models to enhance the generation of relevant and accurate responses. By leveraging Google's PaLM model, this repository aims to provide comprehensive examples and tutorials on how to implement and utilize RAG models effectively.

## What's Inside

This repository includes:

- **Introduction to RAG Models**: A basic overview of RAG models, their architecture, and use cases.
- **Google PaLM Integration**: Instructions and examples on how to integrate Google PaLM with RAG models.
- **Code Samples**: Various Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating RAG model implementations.
- **Step-by-Step Guides**: Detailed walkthroughs of each example, including data preprocessing, model setup, retrieval techniques, and evaluation.
- **Best Practices**: Tips and tricks to optimize the performance of RAG models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)
