# LangChain Document Loaders - RAG Framework Examples

This repository provides examples demonstrating the use of LangChain document loaders within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. Document loaders are essential for enabling language models to access and utilize private data that they wouldn’t otherwise have knowledge of. By integrating various document formats such as text files, PDFs, websites, and JSON files, these loaders help enhance the model's capabilities within the RAG method.

## Introduction

Foundation models, while powerful, do not inherently have access to your private data. This repository showcases how you can use LangChain’s document loaders to integrate external data sources into a RAG-based framework, thereby enriching the model’s ability to generate more informed and contextually accurate responses.

## Why Document Loaders Matter

In the context of the RAG method, document loaders are critical as they enable the language model to:
- Access private or proprietary data stored in various formats.
- Enhance response accuracy by referencing specific and up-to-date information from your datasets.
- Seamlessly integrate multiple data sources, such as text files, PDFs, websites, and more.

## Examples

### TextLoader
This example demonstrates how to load plain text files into the LangChain framework.

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader

loader = TextLoader('your_file.txt', encoding='utf-8')
documents = loader.load()
